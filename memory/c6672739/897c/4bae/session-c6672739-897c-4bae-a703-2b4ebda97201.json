It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P.

Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects.

[77] However, this venture is no longer active. While at IBM, David Kappos was instrumental in establishing the Eco-Patent Commons. [78] This initiative was designed \u2018to provide an avenue by which innovations and solutions may be easily shared to accelerate and facilitate implementation to protect the environment and perhaps lead to further innovation.\u2019 After Kappos left IBM to lead the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the Eco-Patent 74 Glyn Moody, *Digital Code of Life: How Bioinformatics is Revolutionizing Science, Medicine, and* *Business*, Hoboken (NJ): John Wiley & Sons, 2004. 75 Matthew Rimmer, *Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies*, Cheltenham (UK) and Northampton (Mass.): Edward Elgar, September 2011. 76 UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network, http://unfccc.int/ttclear/templates/render _ cms _ page?TEM _ tcn and http://www.unep.org/climatechange/ctcn/ 77 The Green XChange, http://greenxchange.cc/ 78 The Eco-Patent Commons, http://www.wbcsd.org/work - program/capacity - building/eco - patent commons.aspx 22 ----- ## Commons has struggled to have an impact. There have also been a number of open source initiatives in respect of individual clean technology projects. More recently, the World Intellectual Property Organization has established WIPO Green to promote the diffusion of green technology. [79] Eric Lane, a Law Professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, considered the strategy of Tesla Motors in the Green Patent Blog. [80] He considered the precedent of the Eco-Patent Commons, and its mixed success. Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very significant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and legal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to operate are always extremely complex.\u2019 [81] He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will be motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and patent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that technology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own R&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be inferior or unproven technologies.\u2019 [82] Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in respect of clean technologies. In their 2010 book MacroWikinomics, Tapscott and Williams 79 WIPO GREEN, https://www3.wipo.int/wipogreen/en/about/ 80 Eric Lane, \u2018Elon Musk Launches the Tesla-Patent Commons\u2019, *The Green Patent Blog*, 14 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/14/elon - musk - launches - the - tesla - patent - commons/ 81 Ibid. 82 Ibid. 23 ----- ## called for the establishment of a green technology commons. [83] The pair recognised: \u2018It is quickly becoming clear that climate change will be the biggest issue that human civilisation has ever had to deal with.\u2019 [84] Tapscott and Williams were concerned about the limitations of existing responses to the problem of climate change. The writers promoted open and collaborative responses to climate change: \u2018Tackling climate change will not only require unprecedented transformations in our systems of commerce and industry, it will also require fundamental changes\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_11]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] ## Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.\u2019 [13] Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u2019 [14] This statement has attracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual property; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address climate change. 10 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 11 Ibid, 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 5 ----- ## This paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual property, open innovation, and climate change. It is worth situating the story in the context of the growing literature on intellectual property and clean technologies. Professor Peter Menell from the University of California, Berkeley, and Sarah Tran reviewed the canon of key articles in the field in Intellectual Property, Innovation, and the Environment .

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker\\\\\\'s wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker\\\\\\'s goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker\\\\\\'s wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours.

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker\\'s wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker\\'s goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker\\'s wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours.\\n[Source: cricket.txt, ID: cricket_0]', annotations=None)] isError=False"

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion.

Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P.
