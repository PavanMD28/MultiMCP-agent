Fix: Moved input() to a thread using asyncio.to_thread(), added error handling, and cleaned up the prompt logic. 2. Incorrect mcp_server_descriptions Structure Issue: mcp_server_descriptions was passed as a list instead of a dictionary, causing an AttributeError. Fix:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n# Corrected the structure to a dict for AgentContext and a list for MultiMCP. 3. Verbose Tool Outputs Affecting Planning Issue: Long tool outputs overwhelmed the LLM and led to poor or repetitive plans. Fix: Summarized or truncated tool outputs before sending them to the planning LLM. 4. Agent Loop Ending Prematurely (\\\\\"Max Steps Reached\\\\\") Issue: Tasks failed early despite being solvable within step limits. Fix: - Context is now concise (see III.3) - Tools are more robust and efficient (see II.2) - Agent loop better manages states and transitions IV. General Code Robustness 1. Simplified agent.py Loop Issue: Nested while True loops and multiple input() calls caused complexity and double prompts. Fix: Refactored to a single clean input call with proper shutdown of MCP servers on exit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n}', annotations=None)] isError=False"
