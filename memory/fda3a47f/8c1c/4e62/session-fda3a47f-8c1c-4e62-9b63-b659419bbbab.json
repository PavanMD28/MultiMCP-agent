A journey just to catch glimpses of these mysterious, remote, savage giants is the trip of a lifetime for many and, for mountaineers, they\u2019re the ultimate challenge. Rising to way above 8,000m, they stretch through the best part of the Earth\u2019s troposphere, towards the thin air of the stratosphere, reaching heights usually associated with the cruising altitudes of airliners. Up here, conditions are brutal (so your down jackets and winter gloves need to be top-class). The cold is fierce, the oxygen is depleted and nothing survives for very long. All of the tallest mountains in the world are located in Asia, either in the Himalayas or the Karakorum ranges. Of the 10 highest, nine are found in Nepal, including the highest of all: Everest. What is the highest mountain in the world? The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, at 8,849m (29,031ft) above sea level, in the Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalayas. The mountain attracts mountaineers and trekkers from around the globe and, while its easiest routes are technically straightforward by mountaineering standards, its high altitude makes climbing it a hugely dangerous undertaking. It\u2019s known to the Nepalese as Sagarmatha \u2013 loosely translating as \\\\\\'The Head in the Heavens\\\\\\' \u2013 and to the Tibetans as Chomolungma (or Qomolangma) \u2013 loosely meaning \\\\\\'Goddess Mother\\\\\\'. Whatever the exact translations are, the local names are certainly more romantic than \u2018Everest\u2019, the name given to the mountain by the Royal Geographical Society in 1865 in honour of the surveyor George Everest, whose surname is actually pronounced eev-rist. Interestingly, Everest is not the tallest mountain in the world from base to peak. That accolade goes to Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Kea, which rises to 10,210m from bottom to top. So, why isn\u2019t Mauna Kea cited as the highest mountain in the world? Well, around 6,000m of Mauna Kea is underwater, with \\\\\\'only\\\\\\' 4,107m rising above sea level. Then there\u2019s Ecuador\u2019s 6,268m-high Chimborazo, the summit of which, thanks to the Earth\u2019s equatorial bulge, is the highest point from the centre of the planet and therefore the closest mountain to the stars. What are the tallest mountains on each continent? Aconcagua (6,961m), pictured here, is the highest mountain outside of Asia and the highest peak in the Americas \u00a9Almazoff/Shutterstock You may have heard of the Seven Summits, the seven highest peaks on each of the Earth\u2019s separate continents. Many adventurous souls make it their mission to bag each of these special peaks. They are: Asia: Mount Everest (8,849m)South America: Aconcagua (6,962m)North America: Denali (6,194m)Africa: Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m)Europe: Mount Elbrus (5,642m)Antarctica: Vinson Massif (4,892m)Oceania: Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid) (4,884m) Everest is, of course, the highest mountain in Asia and easily the tallest in the Seven Summits list, almost 2,000m higher than its next rival: Aconcagua. Rising above all else in the Andes, Aconcagua is South America\u2019s highest peak. The legendary Denali in Alaska is North America\u2019s loftiest, measuring a whopping 5,500m from valley to summit and reaching a height of 6,194m above sea level. Denali is closely followed by Africa\u2019s iconic Mount Kilimanjaro, a massive dormant volcano and the world\u2019s highest free-standing mountain. Mount Elbrus, another dormant volcano, is Europe\u2019s tallest mountain, located in the Russian Caucasus. The vast, icy, polar desert of Antarctica is crowned by the Vinson Massif, while Oceania\u2019s loftiest point is Puncak Jaya (the Carstensz Pyramid) on New Guinea, the world\u2019s highest island peak. The 10 highest mountains in the world 1. Everest, Himalayas, Nepal Everest, the peak that\\\\\\'s furthest left in this image, is the highest mountain in the world at 8,848m \u00a9Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock Height: 8,849m (29,031ft)First ascent: 29 May 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay The fact that Everest is the highest mountain in the world makes it an irresistible draw to so many. The subject of countless expeditions, daring adventures, stunning films and gripping novels, no other mountain on our planet holds such a fascination with the general public. The stories and names associated with the mountain echo through time: George Mallory, Sandy Irvine, Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Tom Hornbein, Willi Unsoeld, Junko Tabei, Reinhold Messner, Peter Habeler, Joe Taker and Pete Boardman, to name just a few. These days, hundreds achieve the summit every year, most by the two main routes: the South Col Route from Nepal and the Northeast Ridge from Tibet. It\u2019s thought that around 300 people have died attempting to climb the mountain and many bodies remain unrecovered on the mountain. The wider Khumbu region is a hugely popular hiking arena, containing many world class hikes, including the iconic Everest Basecamp trek. 2. K2, Karakorum, Pakistan \u00a9Hussain Warraich/Shutterstock Height: 8,611m (28,251ft)First ascent: 31 July 1954 by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli Cited as the \\\\\\'Savage Mountain\\\\\\' and the \\\\\\'Mountain of Mountains\\\\\\', K2 is the world\u2019s second highest peak and one of its most dangerous. It\u2019s also arguably the most spectacular of them all, an immense, soaring pyramid that calls like a siren to the mountaineering\u2019s elite. Located in Pakistan\u2019s Karakorum range, it\u2019s so remote that the original Western surveyors exploring the region couldn\u2019t find a local name for it. So, they temporarily titled it K2: K for Karakorum and 2 because it was the second prominent peak in a sketch by surveyor Thomas Montgomerie. The name stuck. The Italians claimed the first ascent, via the Abruzzi Spur, in 1954. Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli achieved the summit but it was the efforts of Walter Bonatti and his Hunza companion Amir Mehdi, forced into a controversial bivouac high up in the Death Zone, that have gone down in mountaineering folklore. For many years, the glittering prize of a winter ascent alluded the world\u2019s leading mountaineers until a successful Nepalese expedition, led by Nims Purja, placed 10 climbers on the summit in January 2021. 3. Kanchenjunga, Himalayas, Nepal \u00a9Rounov/Shutterstock Height: 8,586m (28,169ft)First ascent: 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band Kanchenjunga, the world\u2019s 3rd highest mountain, occupies the border between eastern Nepal and India and was once thought to the highest of them all. It\u2019s the only one of the world\u2019s 8,000m summits that the British can claim to have been the first to stand on, although some would point out that Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\u2019s 1953 Everest success was as part of a British expedition. Nevertheless, the first Britons to stand on one of the tallest mountains in the world were Joe Brown and George Band on Kanch (as it\u2019s affectionately known) in 1955. As the mountain is sacred to the Indian Sikkim people, Brown and Band stopped just short of the very summit. 4. Lhotse, Himalayas, Nepal Lhotse is the second-highest peak you can see in this photo, with Mount Everest sitting to it\\\\\\'s right \u00a9Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock Height: 8,516m (27,940ft)First ascent: 18 May 1956 by Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss It could be argued that Lhotse is not a separate mountain, as it\u2019s at the centre of the gargantuan Everest massif, which also contains the prominent Nuptse (7,861m), as well as the tallest mountain in the world. From Everest basecamp, Lhotse rises at the centre of the Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse horseshoe, its stark walls rising high above the Western Cwm. The most popular route that mountaineers take when climbing Everest climbs the Lhotse Face on the way to the South Col, before the brutal push up to the famous summit.
