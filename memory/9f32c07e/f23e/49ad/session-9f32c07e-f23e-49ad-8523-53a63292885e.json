It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P.

[87] He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

He is wearing a black leather jacket. The words \"TIME\" and \"100\" are prominently displayed with accompanying text. The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, \u2018It is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.\u2019 [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: \u2018Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world\u2019s most 94 Joshua Gans, \u2018Intellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations\u2019, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]', annotations=None)] isError=False"
