It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz.

Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl.

Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt.

However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles.

The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias . The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias .
