It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P.
