# Heuristics System Documentation

## Overview
This system implements a comprehensive set of validation heuristics for text processing, security validation, and system management. It provides robust input sanitization, pattern matching, and safety checks for various types of data.

## Query Processing Flow
The system follows a structured flow for processing queries:

1. **Query Input**
   - Receives raw user input
   - Applies initial validation checks
   - Prepares input for processing

2. **Perception**
   - Analyzes query context and intent
   - Identifies key components and requirements
   - Applies pattern recognition
   - Validates input against safety rules

3. **Decision Making**
   - Evaluates processing requirements
   - Selects appropriate validation methods
   - Determines security clearance level
   - Plans execution strategy

4. **Processing**
   - Applies selected heuristics
   - Performs security validations
   - Executes sanitization routines
   - Handles error cases

5. **Action**
   - Implements decided actions
   - Executes tool operations
   - Manages system interactions
   - Handles resource allocation

6. **Result Generation**
   - Formats processed output
   - Validates result integrity
   - Applies final safety checks
   - Prepares response structure

## Components

### 1. Text Validation
The `TextValidation` class provides methods for validating text content:

- **Agent Output Validation (H001)**
  - Validates if output is not an error/status message
  - Checks for bracketed message patterns
  - Verifies against unsuccessful output prefixes

- **Length Limits (H005)**
  - Validates text length within specified bounds
  - Default max length: 10240 characters

- **Digit Validation (H006, H007)**
  - Checks for presence/absence of digits
  - Validates positive integer strings

- **Content Validation (H008, H009)**
  - Verifies non-empty content
  - Checks for balanced brackets

### 2. Security Validation
The `SecurityValidation` class implements security-focused checks:

- **URL Security (H002)**
  - Validates HTTPS protocol usage
  - Ensures secure connections

- **Email Validation (H004)**
  - Validates email format
  - Checks for proper domain structure

- **Content Filtering (H003)**
  - Censors inappropriate language
  - Supports custom bad word lists
  - Default censoring for common inappropriate terms

### 3. System Validation
The `SystemValidation` class manages system-level checks:

- **Tool Validation (H010)**
  - Validates tool names against registry
  - Ensures tool availability

- **Retry Management (H011)**
  - Manages retry attempts
  - Prevents infinite loops

### 4. Query Processing
The `QueryHeuristics` class provides comprehensive query processing:

#### Safety Patterns
Blocks dangerous patterns including:
- System commands (rm, chmod, etc.)
- SQL operations (DROP, DELETE, etc.)
- Sensitive file access
- Dangerous function calls

#### Input Sanitization
Removes or neutralizes:
- Control characters
- JavaScript/VBScript code
- HTML tags
- Malicious expressions
- Excessive whitespace

## Usage

```python
# Initialize QueryHeuristics
heuristics = QueryHeuristics()

# Process a query
processed_query, is_safe = heuristics.process_query("user input here")

# Check security
if SecurityValidation.check_url_is_secure("https://example.com"):
    # Process secure URL

# Validate text
if TextValidation.is_valid_agent_output("response text"):
    # Process valid output

# System checks
if SystemValidation.check_retry_limit(attempts, max_attempts=3):
    # Proceed with retry

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL. Or Summarize answer, if answer
is present in the input.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign i
t to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.

‚úÖ Example 1: Output of last function parsed for next function
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": 
"INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""  
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 
66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)       
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"

```

‚úÖ Example 2: Independent but sequential tool use
```python

    """Search Wikipedia. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence"}}
    result1 = await mcp.call_tool('search', input)
    wiki_text = json.loads(result1.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Fetch News Articles. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)""" 
    input = {"input": {"query": "Artificial Intelligence latest news"}}      
    result2 = await mcp.call_tool('fetch_news', input)
    news_text = json.loads(result2.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FINAL_RESULT
    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: Wikipedia says {wiki_text}. News says {news_text}."


```

‚úÖ Example 3: Fallback logic, parsing not required
```python
import json
async def solve():
    try:
        # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
        """Fetch Company Overview. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('company_overview', input)"""

            """Fetch Company Backup Profile. Usage: input={"company_name": "Tesla"} result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)"""      
            input = {"input": {"company_name": "Tesla"}}
            result = await mcp.call_tool('backup_company_profile', input)    

        except Exception:
            result = {"content": [{"text": "{\\"result\\": \\"Information not available.\\"}"}], "meta": None}

    # FINAL_RESULT
    if isinstance(result, CallToolResult):
        final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
    else:
        final_result = json.loads(result["content"][0]["text"])["result"]    

    return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {final_result}"


```

‚úÖ Example 4: FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: Summarize a document or webpage or 
similar example where you need information to take next action:
```python
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Return clean webpage content. Usage: input={"input": {"url": "https://example.com"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('extract_webpage', input)"""     
    input = {"url": "https://www.f1.com"}
    result = await mcp.call_tool(extract_webpage, input)  # from mcp_server_2
    # FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
    return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {result}"

```

‚úÖ Example 5: Summarize fetched content
```python
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Search documents to get relevant extracts. Usage: input={"input": {"query": "DLF apartment Capbridge"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"query": "DLF apartment Capbridge"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)

    # FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
    return f"FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: {result}"

```

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'.

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' in those cases.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text="DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is 
based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of 
‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it 
leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was 
the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the 
leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of 
the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by 
Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management

the unfair pricing of goods and services. The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda\'s tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This 
matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\'text\', text="DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF 
builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of 
the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside 
the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. 
According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 
30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ‚Çπ31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ‚Çπ15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in 
East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 
21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF 
started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon 
embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ‚Çπ58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ‚Çπ2 billion (US$23 million) for the 
five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\n[Source:

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL. Or Summarize answer, if answer
is present in the input.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign i
t to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.

    input = {"input": {"query": "DLF apartment Capbridge"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('search_stored_documents', input)
```

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'.

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' in those cases.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.

üí° Tips:

If the task can be solved by one tool, stop after that.

You must return the result immediately using 'FINAL_ANSWER:' if you got the result for the user's task, or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:'.

Some times you WILL need to further process the results, like after looking at document, search or webpage parsed, summarizing it. Use 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' in those cases.
Use chaining only if necessary, but never plan more than 1 tool call.

üéØ Input Summary:
- intent='Calculate the 10th Fibonacci number' entities=['Fibonacci', '10'] tool_hint='Fibonacci calculator' tags=[] selected_servers=['math']

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL. Or Summarize answer, if answer
is present in the input.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- You must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- You MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', input)
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call the tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract the value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign i
t to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {parsed}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If the tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.

- No fallback, no multiple options.
- No explanation, no narration ‚Äî only valid Python code.
- If the user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate the final answer from it.

‚úÖ Example 1: Output of last function parsed for next function
```python
import json
async def solve():
    # FUNCTION_CALL: 1
    """Convert characters to ASCII values. Usage: input={"input": {"string": 
"INDIA"}} result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)"""  
    input = {"input": {"string": "INDIA"}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('strings_to_chars_to_int', input)
    numbers = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]

    # FUNCTION_CALL: 2
    """Sum exponentials of int list. Usage: input={"input": {"numbers": [65, 
66, 67]}} result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)"""
    input = {"input": {"numbers": numbers}}
    result = await mcp.call_tool('int_list_to_exponential_sum', input)       
    final_result = json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"]
